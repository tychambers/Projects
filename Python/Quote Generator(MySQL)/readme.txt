This is an application that gets random quotes from Ninja API
You can also connect this application to a MySQL database, I was using this on a database that was local to my server
After connecting to the database you can view the contents of the other quotes that are saved in the database
You must press the "View/Refresh database" to view these contents, and then you can also add and delete items from the db
or move the quote from the db to the viewing portion of the app
